# wp-insecurely-force-smtp

Simple Wordpress plugin which will force sending emails using the SMTP protocol.

This is useful when your hosting provider doesn't let you use the default Wordpress way of sending emails.

!!! This is unsecure since it stores the credentials in plain text. Use at your own risk !!!
